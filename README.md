This is UnityStandardAssets which is very usefull for teaching and learning basics in Unity. But, I do not know why Unity deleted this asset from UnityAssetStores. 

It contains water system, a huamn, a car, a tree, and effects like firework with smoke.

Create an Empty project in Unity and drag and drop this folder to the project.
